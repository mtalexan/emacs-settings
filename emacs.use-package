;; Controls loading of packages so it only occurs if they're needed.
;; Speeds up initial loading.  Only generates a warning if packages are missing,
;; but allows extra logic to occur when package is loaded.

; add to our package search path
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/use-package")
; force load the package
(require 'use-package)
